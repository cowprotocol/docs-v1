# Conclusion

With CoW Hooks, the sky (or rather the MOOn) is the limit! There are many use cases which can now be fully automated with CoW Protocol orders thanks to hooks. Kickstarting some CoWMOOnity creativity: you can set up an order to un-stake a token with a pre-hook, swap it to a different token, then stake the newly received tokens. This allows you to maximize yields, and never hold any un-staked tokens while swapping.

Happy hooking!
