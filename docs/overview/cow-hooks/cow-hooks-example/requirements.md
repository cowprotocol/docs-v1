# Requirements

The sample code shared in this post will assume that you have a recent version of [Deno](https://gist.github.com/) installed. This is just an alternative to JavaScript runtime to NodeJS with some great security features (such as fine-grained access control).

```
% deno --version
deno 1.34.3 (release, aarch64-apple-darwin)
v8 11.5.150.2
typescript 5.0.4
```
